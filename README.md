spectacle-cli
=============

[![npm version][npm_img]][npm_site]
[![Travis Status][trav_img]][trav_site]

A generation tool for [Spectacle][] presentation decks.

## Installation

Either install it globally:

```sh
$ npm install --global spectacle-cli
$ yarn global add spectacle-cli
```

... or use it directly with [npx][] as `npx spectacle-cli`

## Usage

The Spectacle CLI will create a development server to create a `.md` or `.mdx` slides-based deck with additional enhancements for theme overrides, etc.

*Note*: all paths are relative to current working directory (`process.cwd()`).

```sh
$ spectacle -h
Usage: spectacle -s <file>

Options:
  --action, -a   CLI action to run (build, server)  [string] [default: "server"]
  --src, -s      Path to a file from which a presentation will be generated.
                                                [string] [default: "slides.mdx"]
  --theme, -t    Path to a JS/JSON file with theme overrides.           [string]
  --title, -l    Title for the HTML file generated by the Spectacle CLI.
                                              [string] [default: "Presentation"]
  --port, -p     Port for running the Spectacle development server.
                                                        [number] [default: 3000]
  --output, -o   Output directory for built files.    [string] [default: "dist"]
  --help, -h     Show help                                             [boolean]
  --version, -v  Show version number                                   [boolean]
```

Some additional tips:

* `-a|--action`:
    * `server`: Run a development in-memory web-server with hot reload for your presentation.
    * `build`: Output a full production website static build to the `-o|--output` directory.
* `-s|--src`: Source files are relative to current working directory (`process.cwd()`) or can be absolute. If a file has a `.md` suffix is processed as straight Markdown. If a file has a `.mdx` suffix it is processed as enhanced MDX.
* `-t|--theme`: A `require|import`-able file (e.g., `.js` or `.json`) that contains an object to override the Spectacle default theme in places.

## Details

@TODO: `.mdx` vs. `.md` and babel stuff.
